This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common programming error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug.java file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.java provides a corrected version.  The error arises from an off-by-one error in the loop control.  This example serves as a reminder to carefully manage array indices to avoid runtime exceptions.
